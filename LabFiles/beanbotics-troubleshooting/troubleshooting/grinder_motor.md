## Overcurrent Warnings and Motor Protection

### Symptoms
- Frequent overcurrent protection triggers
- Motor stops during grinding cycles
- Automatic recovery after 2-3 seconds
- Increased occurrence during peak hours

### Immediate Checks
1. **Bean Quality**: Remove any foreign objects from hopper
2. **Grind Setting**: Verify grind isn't set too fine
3. **Motor Temperature**: Check if motor housing is overheating

### Diagnostic Procedures
1. **Current Monitoring**:
   - Check motor current draw during normal operation
   - Normal range: 8-12 amps
   - Overcurrent threshold: 15 amps
2. **Burr Inspection**:
   - Remove and inspect grinding burrs for wear
   - Check for coffee oil buildup
   - Verify proper burr alignment
3. **Load Testing**:
   - Run grinder with different bean types
   - Test at various grind settings

### Common Causes & Solutions
- **Worn Burrs**: Replace grinding burrs (every 500-750 lbs of beans)
- **Oil Buildup**: Deep clean burrs with manufacturer-approved cleaner
- **Misaligned Burrs**: Realign or replace burr assembly
- **Motor Wear**: Replace motor if bearings are failing
- **Electrical Issues**: Check wiring harness and connections

### Maintenance Schedule
- Daily: Empty and clean burr chamber
- Weekly: Remove and clean burrs
- Monthly: Calibrate grind settings
- Quarterly: Professional motor inspection
