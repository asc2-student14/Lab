# BeanBotics Milk Frother Troubleshooting Guide

## Poor Foam Quality Issues

### Symptoms
- Thick, heavy foam instead of microfoam
- Foam separates quickly after creation
- Inconsistent foam texture
- Steam pressure appears normal

### Immediate Assessment
1. **Steam Wand Inspection**:
   - Check for milk residue blockages
   - Verify all steam holes are clear
   - Test steam pressure and temperature
2. **Milk Quality Check**:
   - Confirm milk is fresh and properly stored
   - Verify milk type (whole milk works best)
   - Check milk temperature (should be cold)

### Technical Diagnostics
1. **Steam System Analysis**:
   - Measure steam pressure (should be 1.0-1.2 bar)
   - Check steam temperature (should be 150-160°C)
   - Test steam consistency and dry/wet steam ratio
2. **Wand Performance**:
   - Inspect steam wand tip for damage
   - Check internal steam passages
   - Verify automatic cleaning cycle operation
3. **Mechanical Components**:
   - Test steam valve operation
   - Check for internal scaling
   - Verify pressure regulator function

### Solutions
- **Blocked Steam Holes**: Clean with steam wand cleaning tool
- **Milk Buildup**: Deep clean with milk line cleaner
- **Wrong Steam Pressure**: Adjust pressure regulator
- **Damaged Wand Tip**: Replace steam wand tip
- **Scale Buildup**: Descale steam system
- **Valve Problems**: Service or replace steam valve

### Best Practices
- Purge steam wand before and after each use
- Clean wand with damp cloth after each milk drink
- Run automatic cleaning cycle daily
- Use only fresh, cold milk
- Replace steam wand tips monthly
