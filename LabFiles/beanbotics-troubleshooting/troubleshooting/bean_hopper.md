# BeanBotics Bean Hopper Sensor Troubleshooting

## False "Insufficient Beans" Error

### Symptoms
- System shows "insufficient beans" when hopper is full
- Sensor readings inconsistent
- Normal operation interrupted by false alarms
- Hopper appears properly loaded

### Initial Checks
1. **Visual Inspection**:
   - Confirm hopper is actually full
   - Check for bean bridging or clumping
   - Verify hopper is properly seated
2. **Sensor Accessibility**:
   - Ensure sensors aren't blocked by beans
   - Check for coffee dust or debris on sensors
   - Verify sensor mounting is secure

### Sensor Diagnostics
1. **Level Sensor Testing**:
   - Test each sensor individually in diagnostics mode
   - Check sensor voltage readings
   - Verify sensor response to bean level changes
2. **Calibration Check**:
   - Run sensor calibration procedure
   - Compare readings to physical measurements
   - Check calibration drift over time
3. **Electrical Testing**:
   - Test sensor wiring continuity
   - Check for electromagnetic interference
   - Verify power supply to sensors

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **Sensor Contamination**: Clean sensors with compressed air and lint-free cloth
- **Calibration Drift**: Recalibrate sensors according to manual
- **Wiring Problems**: Repair or replace damaged sensor cables
- **Sensor Failure**: Replace faulty sensors
- **Bean Bridging**: Install hopper agitator or modify hopper design
- **Mounting Issues**: Secure loose sensor mounts, replace if damaged

### Preventive Maintenance
- Daily: Visual check of hopper fill level vs. display
- Weekly: Clean sensors and check calibration
- Monthly: Test all sensors in diagnostics mode
- Quarterly: Professional sensor calibration and replacement as needed
